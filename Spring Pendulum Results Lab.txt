Spring Pendulum Results Lab
In today's results lab we had to set both a spring with a block and a pendulum bob in simple harmonic motion and by viewing the sinusoidal force vs time graph of their motions, alter the properties of each system so that the spring will have a period of 1.5 seconds, and the pendulum bob 1 second. We were able to successfully get the desired period times for both systems. When it came to the pendulum bob, what altered the period was the length of the string and the angle at which you set the pendulum in motion, and for the spring what mattered was the mass alone. We received a 6/6 :)
